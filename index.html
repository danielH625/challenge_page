            <p>
                Threat hunters discovered would could be a malicious group trying to uncover secrets that should be kept secret from the common man. From what we understand this group was attempting to uncover secret encryption algorithms.
                They managed to discover an warehouse that the malicious group was using for their research. The FBI was quick to respond and and went to the location.
                The warehouse was completely abandoned execpt for a box hard drives. The drives were quickly brought to the digital forensic team for analysis. It seems as though the malicious group cleaned up pretty well and managed to wipe all the drives... except for one file.
            </p>

                Your mission, is to analyze the file that was recovered from the hard drive.
                What type of file is it (don't forget the file command)?
                What information could the file give us?
                Could it have any information on what this malicous group was up to?
                Follow the trail until there is no more trail to follow!
